# Hoboken-Event-Scheduler
CS546 Final Project

Welcome to our final project, the Hoboken Event Scheduler!

  To get started, pull from main.
  
  Run 'npm install' to install oall of the necessary packages.
  
  Run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with some initial data. The usernames and passwords can be read from the seed file, seed.js.
  
  Finally, run 'npm start'! The website is at: http://localhost:3000


Note: The event recommendation feature of our app works based off of previously attended events. However, the functions do not let you create an event in the past. So to see this feature in action, you can: run the seed file; register for an event; manually change the date of that event to have occured in the past.
