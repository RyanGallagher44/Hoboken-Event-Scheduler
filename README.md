# Hoboken-Event-Scheduler
CS546 Final Project

Welcome to our final project, the Hoboken Event Scheduler!

  *To get started, pull from main.
  
  *Run 'npm install' to install -all of the necessary packages.
  
  *Run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with some initial data. The usernames and passwords can be read from the seed file, seed.js. Depending on when you run the seed script, it may give you an error as our code does not allow you to create events in the past. If this error occurs, you can change the dates of the events in the seed file.
  
  *Finally, run 'npm start'! The website is at: http://localhost:3000


Note: The event recommendation feature of our app works based off of previously attended events. However, our app does not let you create an event in the past. So to see this feature in action, you can: run the seed file; register for an event; manually change the date of that event in MongoDB to have occured in the past. Doing this will also allow you to see past events attended/hosted in the user profile page.


I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.
